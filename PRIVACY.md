Flippit interacts with Google Play Games Services (GPGS) to access data required for managing multiplayer games, via the Turn Based Multiplayer API (https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/turnbasedMultiplayer). This includes requesting the email ID for which users wish to log into Google Play Games. This data is not collected or shared with third-party services, nor stored on any intermediary servers between GPGS and the Flippit Android application.

Questions? Feel free to send any email to the developer. Contact information is available on the Google Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ddiehl.android.reversi).
