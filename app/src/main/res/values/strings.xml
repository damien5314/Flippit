    <string name="how_to_play_p1">
		In Reversi there are two players, each represented by light or dark spaces on the game board.
        The objective is to capture more spaces on the game board than your opponent.
	</string>

    <string name="how_to_play_p2">
		Players take turns claiming spaces with at least one of their opponent\'s pieces in between the claimed space and one of their own spaces.
        After claiming a space, all of the opponent\'s spaces in between the claimed space and one of their own spaces are claimed by the player.
	</string>

    <string name="how_to_play_p3">
		If at any point in the game a player has no valid moves, the turn will be passed back to the other player.
        The game continues until neither player has any valid moves, or all spaces on the game board are claimed.
	</string>

    <string name="how_to_play_p4_header">Strategy</string>
    <string name="how_to_play_p4">
		A good starting strategy for Reversi is to focus on claiming "stable" spaces which are unable to be flanked by your opponent later in the game.
        The four corner spaces are considered to be the most valuable, followed by spaces along the edges.
        Spaces immediately adjacent to the corners and edges should be avoided as these provide an opportunity for your opponent to claim stable spaces.
