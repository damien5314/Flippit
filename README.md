Flippit
=======

Reversi, a board game invented in the 19th century, is simple to learn, yet difficult to master. The objective of Reversi is to convert your opponent's game spaces, by claiming a space which forms a line between at least one of your opponent's spaces and one of your own spaces. Players alternate turns claiming spaces until both players are out of valid moves.

There are two game modes in Flippit. Single player mode offers two levels of difficulty. Multiplayer mode allows you to invite Google+ friends to play a Reversi match, or be randomly matched against another Flippit user. There are also a few achievements which can be obtained by playing multiplayer matches.

I have done my best to adapt Flippit to work on the most common device types and screen sizes, but I am still a learning developer. If there is any issue with your particular device, feel free to post a review or send me an email with your specific device and I will do my best to post an update which solves your issues. Thanks for playing!
